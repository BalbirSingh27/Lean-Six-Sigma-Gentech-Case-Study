---

## 🏢 About Gentech

Gentech is a global multinational firm with an annual revenue of \$60 billion. Recently, the company experienced an **18% decline in revenue**, prompting a detailed operational investigation.

---

## ❓ Problem Statement

Identify root causes for declining revenue and **optimize the proposal creation process** using **Lean Six Sigma DMAIC methodology** (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control).

---

## 🧠 Lean Six Sigma Tools & Techniques Used

* **DMAIC Framework** (Define → Measure → Analyze → Improve → Control)
* **Fishbone Diagram** – Root cause analysis
* **Poka-Yoke** – Error-proofing for configuration fields
* **DPMO** – Defects Per Million Opportunities
* **Control Charts (X̄-R)** – Monitor process variability and stability

---

## 🔍 Key Findings

* 📉 **21,079** transactions breached the 35-day SLA
* 🔎 Major bottlenecks: **ZQT6 & ZQT8** bid types
* ⚠️ Common issues:

  * Long wait times
  * Manual interventions
  * Incomplete or incorrect configurations
  * Lack of BSS (Bid Support Specialist) training

---

## ✅ Lean Six Sigma Solutions

* 🛡️ **Poka-Yoke**: Mandatory fields clearly marked
* ⏳ **Approval optimization**: Only large bids reviewed by Proposal Manager
* 🎓 **Training enhancement**: Regular domain training for BSS agents
* 🔁 **Process redesign**: Faster, standardized proposal cycle

---

## 📈 Business Impact

* ⏱️ **Cycle time reduced**: From 32 → 26 days (18% reduction)
* 💰 **Revenue increase**: Estimated **\$1.6 Billion** gain from efficiency

---

## 🧰 Tools Used

`DMAIC` • `Fishbone Diagram` • `Poka-Yoke` • `Control Charts` • `KPI Tracking`

---

## 📌 Control Phase Recommendations

* Establish KPIs for SLA, process quality, and throughput
* Use **X̄-R control charts** for proposal cycle monitoring
* Create documentation & feedback loops
* Incentivize SLA adherence across teams
